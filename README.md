# MC Setup

### INTRO
A set of files used in the configuration process for OOB and reimaged mac clients in the Portsmouth School Department.

### PURPOSE
Together these files make configuration changes common to all mac clients and which are not possible or impractical to do through configuration profiles.

### USAGE
Download the files and run `makeinstall.sh`, place the resulting file __firstboot.pkg__ into the Packages directory on the DeployStudio server.
